/* FOR FRIDAY's PRESENTATION DO NOT EDIT */
/* these are notes/braindumps obtained after trawling through the codebase */

misc.
- in order to add extra features (and fix critical bugs): I pulled an all-nighter on friday
  ah, there goes a whole week of productivity ;-;

=== (somewhat cool) stuff we did
- using tech CEOs as avatars
  - teehee
- using glitch features
  - [automatic code formatting] w/ command+option+S
  - using git URL
    - git clone <our project URL>
    - periodically ran `git pull` (have you met my dear friend, Justin Case?)
- generating random pellet coordinates with a gaussian distribution
  - this was needed needed to balance the gameplay
    - [prob.] pellets cluster near the center of the game's arena, which is where all the action is
    - [soln.] looked up CLT: adding 2 uniformly random numbers yields a gaussian distribution
- importing the whole p5.play library, pouring over the documentation, yet only using it for *one* thing
  (the camera)
  - considered doing manually, but decided against it because laziness^W efficiency ;>
- figuring out that you could make an arena for a game that exceeds the screen size of any monitor
  - as long as you kept track of both the "real" arena dimensions, and the user's screen dimensions
- using kewl trixx & mad haxx from math/programming competitions
  - round a random decimal number to the nearest integer *without doing any comparisons*
    floor(random(1)+0.5)
  - randomly indexing into an array
    Math.floor(rng(9999)) % <some arry>.length;
  - calculating the number of game objects based on screen dimensions
    <some game object> = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(screenX * screenY));

- okok; these were mostly a waste of time, but fun to play around with

=== cool stuff we didn't do
- too much to list (I have a > 100 line .txt file full of nothing but ideas :<)

=== (weirddd) bugs I fixed
- weird bug where the game would crash almost immediately after starting
  - root cause: somewhere in the code I wrote 
    => this.size += this.size + <some constant>, but what I *actually* meant to write was
    => this.size += <some constant>
  - this one-character bug took >= 2 hours of debugging. ONE. CHARACTER.
